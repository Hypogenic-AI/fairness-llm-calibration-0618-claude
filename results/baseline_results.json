However, it does not demonstrate or provide evidence of the model's current ability to handle context switches. The answer is focused on training strategies rather than evaluating an existing model's performance in context-switching. Based on the rubric, since there is no direct evidence of the model's ability to handle context switches, a score cannot be given for actual performance. However, if we interpret the response as describing a model that currently \"often loses track of the conversation, resulting in a disjointed and confusing dialogue\" (as stated in the user's prompt), this would correspond to a model that cannot manage context switches.\n\n[RESULT] 1",

      "The response is concise and avoids unnecessary detail, but it is too brief to be considered comprehensive. It correctly states that quantum superposition allows particles to be in multiple states and that the double-slit experiment demonstrates this, but it omits important clarifications. For example, it doesn't explain what \"states\" means in this context, how the interference pattern forms, or why observation causes the collapse. These omissions may leave a student still confused about the core concepts. Thus, the response misses key information needed for a comprehensive understanding.\n\n[RESULT] 2",
